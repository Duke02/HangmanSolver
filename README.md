# HangmanSolver
A simple hangman game where the computer can either help you 
play your own game of hangman or can try to guess your word.

This was inspired by a game of Hangman at work today where I
said I would make a solver for the game.

Thankfully, this (possibly cheating) software also showcases a
good bit of functional programming in Python, which I am
currently trying to improve upon in my own time.

Hope you enjoy!

## Tools Used

site](https://regexr.com/) helped me a lot when I was first learning them.
